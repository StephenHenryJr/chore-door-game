# chore-door

This code is a simple game called "Chore Door". It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate a random door with an image behind it. One door has an image of a robot, and the others have images of a beach or space. The goal is to avoid opening the door with the robot behind it.

The game has three doors, and the player can click on them to reveal what's behind them. If the player opens the door with the robot, they lose the game. If they open a door without the robot, they get closer to winning.

The game starts when the player clicks the "Good Luck!" button, which will reveal the random images behind the doors. The game ends when the player opens all the doors or opens the door with the robot. The player can then start a new game by clicking the button again.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS:

- Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.

- Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.

- If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!

- See if you can score a winning streak!
