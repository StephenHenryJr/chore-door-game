# chore-door

Chore Door game project. 
In this case we use the JS DOM and create functions in order to make the game function. 


**INSTRUCTIONS**
1	Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.
2	Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.
3	If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!
4	See if you can score a winning streak!
